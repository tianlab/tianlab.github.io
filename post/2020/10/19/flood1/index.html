<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
<p>Outline:
Water has been closely associated with human being since ancient civilization periods. It has interacted with the people in critical fields for their existence such as health, food, energy, disasters, and environment. It underpinned social and economic development of regions and enhanced welfare and happiness of the inhabitants if managed properly. Water has affected, in many ways, formulation of the culture and society. Learning the process through which interaction of the people and water has formulated culture and civilization will give us hints to build optimal relations between environment and humanity in the future. It will also help us explore better ways to adapt to climate and other global changes.</p>
<p>In this context, Professor Nizar Abu Jaber will give lecture on "Flood Control and Water Management in Nabatean Petra. Professor Abu-Jaber is a geologist working in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the German Jordanian University. He also heads the Center for the Study of Natural and Cultural Heritage at the same university. He has almost three decades of experience in research and project development and management in the fields of geology, archaeometry, landscape studies, geochemistry as well as surface and groundwater.</p>
<p>Human interaction with and management of the difficult landscape of Petra is a testament to the ability of ancient civilizations to cope with water-related challenges. Poor data and the lack of modern heavy equipment or modeling tools were not an obstacle to effective flood control and water management. In this lecture, there will be an overview of the climate, geology and landscape of Petra, the Nabateans and their footprint on the region as well their flood and water control systems. This will be followed by a discussion about GJU’s projects that are aimed to better understand the hydrology of the area, mimic the flood control technology and explore how the lessons learnt can be used in modern contexts. The project team ensures a truly multidisciplinary approach, with experts in geology, geomatics, hydrology and archaeology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>The physical setting</li>
<li>The human setting</li>
<li>The need for landscape management</li>
<li>What we see (visible archaeology)</li>
<li>Project approach and data collection</li>
<li>Current results and future research foci</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a unique opportunity for researchers, students, and experts who are interested on this subject to view the lecture and exchange views with Professor Nizar Abu Jaber. Active participation by all will be very welcome.</p>
